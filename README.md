# Digit-Recognizer-Using-CNN
This is my first project in Deep Learning and hence chosen the classic digit recogniser project.

A deep learning digit recognizer model using kaggle dataset to determine the digit by taking images of a handwritten single digit. For every image in the test set, it should predict the correct number written. This has been achieved using the Keras tool in DL.
Three different optimizers are used here to compare the accuracy of the model - Adam, RMSprop, SGD.

First, I clean the data and visualise the data by plotting graphs. I learnt how to pre process the data and tune different parameters during model building to see the various type of results that I might get. By choosing different optimisers we can achieve the accuracy the gives us the best results. After training the model, I test the model with a different test dataset.
